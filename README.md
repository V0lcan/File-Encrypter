# File encrypter
This is a simple file and image encrypter/decrypter.

**Important:**
After a file has been encrypted, do not delete the .key file since that will delete the key
needed to decrypt the file again.

**How to use:**
1. Run script
2. Press the "Select file" button to select a file to encrypt (or copy & paste the filepath)
3. Press encrypt

**How to decrypt file:**
Same as previous but press decrypt instead.
